This dataset consists of 3 subsets:

- Leaves of the most common Austrian broad leaf trees: Ash (25), Beech (30), Hornbeam (34), Mountain oak (22), Sycamore maple (23)
- Bark of the most common Austrian trees: Ash (34), Beech (16), Black pine (166), Fir (127), Hornbeam (42), Larch (200), Mountain oak (77), Scots pine (190), Spruce (213), Swiss stone pine (96), Sycamore maple (22)
- Needles of the most common Austrian conifers: Black pine (107), Fir (10), Larch (114), Scots pine (10), Spruce (13), Swiss stone pine (21)

Australian trees: <60, 60-80, >80 


### 2) Pl@nNet-300k Dataset (31 GB!!) 

PlantNet-300K https://github.com/plantnet/PlantNet-300K This repository contains the code used to produce the benchmark in the paper "Pl@ntNet-300K: a plant image dataset with high label ambiguity and a long-tailed distribution". You can find a link to the paper here. In order to train a model on the PlantNet-300K dataset, you first have to download the dataset here.
