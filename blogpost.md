# Blogpost Trees


### Our Path: From idea to application

Original idea: 
- The CO2 absorption of trees depends on their species, age and location.
- Learn about and predict the CO2 absorption of trees in Berlin

Our application will allow the user
- to gain more information about trees in their selected district of Berlin.
- to identify trees simply by uploading pictures with their smartphone or Laptop.

Vision: Facilitate people in Berlin to gain more knowledge about the trees surrounding them and on the trees impact on the environment in terms of CO2 absorption.
