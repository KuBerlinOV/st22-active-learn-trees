### Our Path: From idea to application

Original idea: 
- The CO2 absorption of trees depends on their species, age and location.
- Learn about and predict the CO2 absorption of trees in Berlin

Our application will allow the user
- to gain more information about trees in their selected district of Berlin.
- to identify trees simply by uploading pictures with their smartphone or Laptop.

Vision: Facilitate people in Berlin to gain more knowledge about the trees surrounding them and on the trees impact on the environment in terms of CO2 absorption.

### UX: Define the macro-design direction
Upon liasing with the WD track, the UX presented the first design sketch (created via Sketch) with team and recorded rough ideas. UX research was futher carried out on the target audience ("Whose problem will the app solve"?) and personas were collected though with some challenges as our product is quite unique and a thorough understanding of its purpose was required. After defining the design direction, the initial sketch was futher adjusted into a low fidelity wireframe and then developed into an interactive prototyp with figma. Details of structure and the prototype was presented to team while making adjustments were necessary.

## Web development
So basically we were informed to develope the app on React, which was introduced to us not long ago, so we had to face handsome amount of difficulties which on the other hand made us learn new things vey quickly, on React the code is components based, which makes it cleaner and reuasable. We were able to move changing data from component to component without many nasty hiccups. Again, the introduction to these technologies meant that we had to learn a great deal more than what was originally offered in the academic phase, but its outcome was immeasurably useful for us emerging developers.</p>

### Back-End

<p> As both WD techies chose the front-end course during the academic phase, suddenly being confronted with back-end logic and challenges was certainly a challenge and required adaptability and time-investment. Luckily, under the guidance of the experienced mentors, back-end difficulties were overcome and its logic proved to be less of a frightening obstacle to us, the front-end techies. </p>

The overall development process is illustrated below. It should also be mentioned that the tasks were not always worked on one after the other, but that work was often done in parallel on different challenges. Team WD decided to split the work based on interests and understanding of the code. This proved to be a successful decision in team communication in order to reach the ambitious goals. Through careful coordination, trust in each otherâ€™s abilities, and a great deal of motivation, challenges were overcome. Although some bugs remain, some functions are still merely placeholders, and the usability is rather limited due to the lack of responsiveness, the progress we made in such a short time was so unimaginable at the beginning of this bootcamp that this project for us in the WD track can only be considered a success. A great learning experience that we will bring to all pending future projects.  <br><br>

##  Data science
The data science track was responsible for collecting trees data around Berlin, clean it, present it through different visualisations, and build a machine learning model to predict trees age. The data is collected from the website of the Senate Department for the Environment, Urban Mobility, Consumer Protection and Climate Action in Berlin. 

We cleaned the dataset from anomalies, like mixed up age and planting year. And then stored in the drive under the following link https://www.notion.so/Cleaned-Dataset-Visualizations-6eeb0250bcb44278b4d4449a38783b49#d503c1c276214002b36c347142fdd781 and a table containing the dataset is created in the supabase database.

### Visualizations per species
The visualizations were done according to two categories which are based on tree species and based on Berlin district. 
The main statistics performed on trees per their species showcase the following:
    -- The number of trees per species

### Visualizations per district
We decided that the following information will be interesting for every district:
* Top 10 most common species per district (and visualization)
* Top 10 streets with most trees per district (and visualization)
* Hightest tree
* Oldest tree

Here are examples for Berlin Mitte:

### Machine Learning: Estimating Age
The machine learning algorithm was trained to predict the age. First, the trees age is calculated based on the growth factor of each tree species. These are the formulas used to calculate age:
    -- diameter = circumference / 3.14  (Pi)
    -- age = diameter * growth factor
 
 The main variables of the linear regression model are X (contains: tree height, girth, crown diameter, tree diameter), and Y ( estimated age: calculated by the above formula)
 The linear regression statistics are as follows:
    -- Coefficients: [[ 0.00522242  0.76037409 -0.020068    0.24215735]]
    -- Intercept: [9.14116479]
    -- Mean squared error (MSE): 963.87
    -- Coefficient of determination (R^2): 0.26
 The regression model results in a predicted Y that is used against the estimated Y to draw the following scater plot:

# Final remarks

UX: " Being the only UX techie in team made me quite skeptical at first but I was more than enthusiatic to jump on the challenge! Overall, it was a challenging, yet educative experience, having to work with a team of dedicated individuals and to explore act of designing!"
